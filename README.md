 # Building Malware
 Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files of a system and
 decrypts only after a sum of money is paid to the attacker.
 Encryption is the process of encoding information so only authorized parties can
 access it.

 There are two main types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
 In symmetric encryption (which we will be using), the same key we used to
 encrypt the data is also usable for decryption. In contrast, in asymmetric
 encryption, there are two keys, one for encryption (public key) and the other for
 decryption (private key). Therefore, to build ransomware, encryption is the
 primary process.
There are a lot of types of ransomware. The one we will build uses the same
password to encrypt and decrypt the data. In other words, we use key derivation
